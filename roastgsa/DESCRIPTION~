Title: Rotation based gene set analysis
Authors@R: person("Adria", "Caballe", email = "adria.caballe@irbbarcelona.org",role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package implements several functions useful for
             gene set analysis using rotations to approximate the
	     null distribution. Several functions are available to reach a complete graphical
	     representation of the results. Among them, a p-value curve used to approximate
	     the effective signature size of the tested set and that can be linked to the power of the test.
